# A Shfi Odyssey

## In our game, you assume the role of a fish by the name of Shfi who feels out of place in the ocean, and you wish to escape the waters and become a part of the human world. You have long admired the Ocean Sages who fled aquatic life to assimilate with humans on land. You are in awe of their wisdom and proximity to humans and want to find them to seek their guidance. One day, you hear rumors that one of the Ocean Sages was spotted at the bustling port city of Guangzhou, and you muster up the courage to leave your home reef and take off to find the first Ocean Sage. Through the game, you explore real world port towns and gain powers from each Sage Fish that enhance your fishy powers. In each port town you visit, you are tasked with helping the humans with a problem, but each problem is something only you can solve as a fish. In the end, you realize that being a human isnâ€™t what you really want, and you recognize all the special qualities that make you amazing as a fish.
